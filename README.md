## Startup Documentation: 

This comprehensive startup documentation guides you through setting up, testing, deploying, and interacting with the Sale Agreement smart contract. This contract facilitates agreements for the sale of tangible items in exchange for ETH or ERC-20 tokens, incorporating an arbitrator's role for dispute resolution.

## Project Overview:

The Sale Agreement project features a Solidity smart contract designed for the Ethereum blockchain. It supports creating sale agreements, depositing payments, resolving disputes, and managing arbitrators.

## Prerequisites:

## Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- [Node.js (v12.x or higher)](https://nodejs.org/en)

- [npm (bundled with Node.js)](https://www.npmjs.com/)

- [An IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Setting Up the Development Environment

## Clone the Repository:
Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```

## Install Dependencies: 
Navigate to the project's root directory and install the necessary npm packages.

```sh
npm install
```


## Configure Hardhat: 
The project utilizes Hardhat. Review and adjust hardhat.config.js for network configurations as needed.


## Writing Smart Contracts:
Smart contracts are located in the contracts/ directory, with SaleAgreement.sol being the primary contract. It includes functionalities such as agreement creation, payment deposition, and dispute resolution.


## Compiling Contracts:
Compile the smart contracts to generate ABI and bytecode:

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```


## Running Tests
Automated tests are in the test/ directory.
Execute these tests to verify contract behaviors:

```sh
npx hardhat test
```


## Running Test Coverage
For thorough testing, run test coverage analysis using solidity-coverage:

```sh
npx hardhat coverage
```

This generates a report detailing test coverage metrics, helping identify untested code sections. Review the coverage/ directory for an in-depth report.

## Deploying the Contract

Deploy the contract to either a local or a public network:

Local Network Deployment:

## Start a local node:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

## Then, deploy:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```


## Public Network Deployment:

Ensure a .env file contains necessary configurations (e.g., API_URL, PRIVATE_KEY).

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```


## Interacting with the Contract

Interact with the deployed contract using Hardhat scripts. Example:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network localhost
```

## Security and Best Practices

- Conduct regular smart contract audits.
- Adhere to security best practices, as recommended by OpenZeppelin.
- Updating the Project.
- Iteratively develop by writing, compiling, testing, and deploying. Always aim for comprehensive test coverage and adhere to best practices for security and efficiency.
